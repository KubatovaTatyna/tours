Our trip with Nomad's  Trail to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan was phenomenal. It far exceeded my expectations. Everything was top quality including the accommodations, food, sights, itinerary and outstanding guides and drivers. It was an excellent quality tour for the money. I would highly recommend Ramilya and Mirlan.`,

        They took care of us in many ways - ensuring we were well fed even while stopping by their home enroute to Altyn Arashan for supplies. Accomodating our requests - taking us to the best place to purchase local SIM cards for data. Encouraging and physically helping us through the snow to reach the Ala-Kul Lake at Altyn Arashan.
        
        It was an unforgettable experience; thank you Ramilya, Samat and Rustam :)`,
